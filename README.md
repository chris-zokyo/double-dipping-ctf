### Double Dipping CTF


AVA Dao is the latest and greatest overcollateralised stablecoin which has just hit the market. They are offering their AVA stable coin tokens in exchange for WETH and a rewards incentive for new users for each WETH deposited capped at 10 GAVT (Governance Token).

Alice and Bob have already made their deposits in exchange for AVA Tokens and have claimed their GAVT rewards! 

You start with 10 WETH tokens but you must claim more rewards for yourself. Rumour has it the protocol wasn't audited so is GAVT really capped for each user?
